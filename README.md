✝️ How Love-n-Care Ministries Began ❤️

Growing up as an ‘untouchable’ Dalit in a poor remote Indian village, Yesupadam turned to communism at the young age of 11 as a means of taking revenge upon a society that rejected and hated him. For 13 years he lived as an atheist and alcoholic, given over to violence, rebellion, and communist gangs. He had rejected Christianity, a ‘Western religion’ that his father had embraced after hearing the Gospel from a Canadian Baptist missionary. However, on January 26, 1976 GOD JESUS SAVIOR appeared to Yesupadam. He saw with his naked eyes, the form of A MAN hanging on a cross with blood drops falling down from HIS nail pierced hands. GOD JESUS SAVIOR spoke to him audibly, ‘Son, I have done all this for you, what will you do for ME?’ Instantly converted and completely transformed, Yesupadam responded back, ‘Now I know YOU are GOD. Until the last breath of my life I will believe in YOU and will tell to my people that YOU are GOD.’ Since that time, his life has been passionately devoted to that mission.

After his radical conversion, Yesupadam spent more than three years in Iraq working for the government as a medical technician, for the purpose of sharing the Gospel with Iraqis. Despite the political and religious opposition there, Yesupadam planted three underground Churches and baptized many new Believers who heard the Good News of GOD JESUS SAVIOR through his Ministry. Upon his return to India in 1983, Yesupadam left his job and gave himself to full-time Ministry to Believers in the local Church and the lost people especially in the tribal villages. Yesupadam’s Ministry in India has been marked by a burning heart to see India reached with the Good News of GOD JESUS SAVIOR.

In 1988, Yesupadam saw a Vision of two hands holding the globe, with the words ‘GOD JESUS SAVIOR Loves Cares’ across, and the names of 5 countries written below, namely U.S., Canada, West Germany, Sweden, and South Africa . Thus Love-n-Care Ministries International was birthed, with a burden not only for India but also for the world and specifically these 5 nations.

In 1990 Love-n-Care Ministries was incorporated in India and began planting Churches and training young men to be Evangelists, Pastors and Churches Planters. With a Word from GOD JESUS SAVIOR to ‘penetrate into the communities’ in order to meet the spiritual and physical needs of the people, the Ministry began taking in the poor and suffering children, caring for the elderly and training disabled polio-affected young adults in various vocations. Love-n-Care Ministries also constructed a 25 bed hospital and began a nursing school, while regularly conducting free medical outreaches in poor villages. In addition, they facilitate computer, printing and tailoring training, printing literature and recording music, Evangelism, Crusades and Pastor’s conferences, flood and disaster relief, starting small businesses and caring the hiv positive families.

✝️ Ministries ❤️

✝️ Children's Ministries ❤️

Bethany Children's Homes began in 1991 when Yesupadam was reminded by GOD JESUS SAVIOR about his years of malnutrition and starvation as a young child. Burdened for orphans and families that could not provide basic care for their children, the first home began in Visakhapatnam India with 25 children, and presently hundreds of impoverished children ages 3 and up are being cared for in different locations. Many are now grown and contributing members of society in India and abroad. Love-n-Care Ministries provides these children with 3 meals a day, clothing, books and school uniforms, excellent education in english, and complete health care. Most importantly, these children are cared for spiritually through daily training in the Scriptures, waking every morning at 5:00 for Prayer and Worship and maintaining a disciplined and well-balanced daily schedule. They are being raised up as a mighty Army of GOD to establish a new generation to reach India and the ends of the earth with the Gospel.

✝️ Educational Ministries ❤️

Bethany Public Schools

Bethany Public Schools were established to uphold the Vision of training well-disciplined, GODly children in a loving environment. From nursery to 10th grade, these schools are "privately" run by Love-n-Care Ministries for the children in the homes, but are also open to the public and focus on excellence in education with a spiritual emphasis.

Disabled Vocational Training Programs

Shunned by society but desperately in need of hope and a future, disabled young men and women are being trained by Love-n-Care Ministries in the Printing Press, Computer Center, and Tailoring Center in a 1 year program. The Indian government provides a certificate for each graduate, enabling them to begin their own business or find employment which helps them support their families. A Baptist Church in Utah provides each graduate of the Tailoring program with their own treadle style sewing machine.

✝️ Medical Ministries ❤️

Bethany Christian Hospital and Dental Clinic

Due to the lack of medical care for Yesupadam's poor family growing up, his heart is burdened to meet the immense physical needs of the Indian communities. Love-n-Care Ministries began a 25 bedded hospital in 2003 which provides basic health care, lab, x-ray and pharmacy facilities, surgeries, labor and delivery care, physical therapy, orthopedic and dental specialties. Presently, a 100 bedded facility is under construction in order to reach the community with complete specialized care.

Bethany School of Nursing

(Registered Nurse or Registered Childbirth Helper)
Begun in 2003, this 3 1/2 year program trains young men and young women as qualified nurses and childbirth helpers, well-equipped for India and abroad. Students are welcome to join from any state in India, to be trained by qualified staffs in a loving, stable environment. Contact us for more information.

Bethany Old Age Home

The need for this Home came when itinerant Evangelist and Pastor S.I. Samuel came to Yesupadam at the age of 80 requesting a home, after serving GOD JESUS SAVIOR for 40 years without his own place to rest his head. He lived fruitfully sharing the Gospel throughout India until the ripe age of 104. The Home was named after one of the first American to visit Love-n-Care, Rev. Lloyd Linton, who went to be with GOD JESUS SAVIOR shortly after his trip to India. Linton Old Age Home will be expanding to a new 100 bed facility in the near future, to take in more elderly in need of physical and spiritual care.

✝️ Outreach Ministries ❤️

Discipleship Training Centers

After many years of personal Evangelism especially to the unreached tribal people living in the Eastern Ghats' mountain range, Yesupadam saw the need for Pastors to plant Churches. GOD JESUS SAVIOR answered this need at an altar call in a remote tribal area when 28 young men committed their lives to reach their people for GOD JESUS SAVIOR. Thus, in 1990, the first Discipleship Training Center (DTC) began. A one-year program with the Bible as the textbook, young men and young women are trained for Ministry and then sent out to Evangelize and plant Churches. With two schools in Andhra Pradesh and one in Chhattisgarh, over 1800 students have been trained in 18 years and have planted over 1000 Churches, 300 of which are under the Leadership of Love-n-Care.

Pastor's Conferences and Crusades

Love-n-Care Ministries arranges Crusade meetings and conducts seminars to equip Pastors and Leaders through Bible based teaching.

Tribal Village Outreach

One of the main focuses of Love-n-Care Ministries since 1990 has been to bring the Gospel to every tribal village in the Eastern Ghats' mountains of Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, Madhya Pradesh and Chattisgarh. Every year in the month of April all male Bible School students, staff and Pastors trek into the mountains and go village to village handing out tracts and showing GOD JESUS SAVIOR film. In 2007, all the villages in this mountain range were reached with the Gospel of GOD JESUS SAVIOR through Love-N-Care Ministries! Other areas are now being focused on each April.

Bethany "Prayer Tower"

Challenged by the passionate Prayer life of the Korean Churches, Prayer has become the backbone and reason for the amazing fruitfulness of Love-n-Care Ministries over the years. 24 hours of daily Prayer, year round, is the continual goal. Bethany Prayer Tower began in a small shed, now is located in an underground room and the Vision is to build a Prayer Mountain with beautiful conference halls and private Prayer rooms.

✝️ Projects ❤️

Our Present Project

Web: www.bethanyhospital.org

The government of India miraculously sold Love-n-Care Ministries 5 acres of land which included a mountain. GOD JESUS SAVIOR had shown Yesupadam this exact place in 1997 as part of a Vision to build a "Prayer Mountain", and after 7 years of Prayer, GOD JESUS SAVIOR released it! This land has now been excavated and leveled, fully prepared for the construction of the following:

Prayer Mountain: located on the top of the mountain, with a Prayer hall and individual rooms for 24 hour Prayer.

Hospital: a 100-bedded facility at the foot of the mountain, fully equipped to meet the physical needs of the community, with a special focus towards cancer patients, children, and pregnant women.

Mentally Disabled Home: caring for the mentally challenged who are seen as outcasts in society.

Old Age Home: meeting the needs of the elderly and allowing them to be involved in the care of the mentally challenged.

Staff Housing: for the staff of the above facilities.

✝️ Specialized Ministries ❤️

Bethany Printing Press and Publishing Ministry

With the burden to provide Christian literature in the local Telugu language, Yesupadam began a Printing Press. Graduating from a letter by letter, black and white typeset press to a multi-colored offset press, Love-n-Care Ministries has ministered over the years to thousands in India through a freely distributed monthly booklet, Eternal Life Magazine. As well as doing service for the public, the press is used for the vital purpose of training disabled young adults in printing and publishing which enables them to find employment as well as dignity in society.

Bethany Computer Center

Professional teachers train the children in our schools in computer skills, as well as disabled young adults in basic and advanced programs that help them find employment. The Bethany Computer Center also provides public access to the Internet for the community.

Bethany Tailoring Center

The knowledge of sewing, tailoring and designing can provide substantial income for an Indian family. Bethany Tailoring Center provides daily training for Love-N-Care's Bible School girls and disabled young adults. After successfully graduating from the 1 year course, each disabled student receives a certificate from the government as well as their own new sewing machine, lovingly donated by a Baptist Church in the US.
